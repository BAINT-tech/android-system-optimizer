- No root required (future versions may use root for full analysis)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to `bloatware/` folder
3. For now, review methodology and sample logs
4. Future: executable script will automate detection

## Logs
All analysis logs are saved in the `logs/` folder for reference.
