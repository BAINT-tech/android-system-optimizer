## Problem

Millions of Android users rely on low-end or aging devices.
Over time, these devices become slow, laggy, and battery-inefficient
due to background processes, heavy system animations, and OEM bloatware.

Most users cannot safely modify system behavior without flashing
custom ROMs or risking device stability.

This leads to:
- Poor user experience
- Shortened device lifespan
- Increased cost of replacing phones

There is a need for safe, documented system-level optimizations
that improve Android performance without requiring full ROM changes.
