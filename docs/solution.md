## Solution

Android System Optimizer is an experimental project that documents
and implements system-level optimizations for Android devices.

The project focuses on:
- Reducing unnecessary system animations
- Limiting background resource usage
- Improving battery efficiency
- Extending the usable life of low-end devices

Optimizations are delivered as:
- Shell scripts
- System configuration changes
- Clear documentation of impact and risks

The goal is not to replace Android, but to improve how it behaves
on real-world devices.
