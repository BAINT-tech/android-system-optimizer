# Android System Optimizer

A system-level Android experimentation project focused on improving
performance, battery life, and usability on low-end devices.

## Problem
Many Android devices become slow and battery-inefficient due to
background processes, animations, and OEM bloat.

## Goal
To document and build system-level optimizations that improve
Android performance without requiring custom ROMs.

## Current Status
- Problem definition completed
- Initial system experiment documented
- First system optimization script added
